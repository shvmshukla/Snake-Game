# Snake-Game

This is a simple "Snake" Game, made by me, completely in JavaScript. The working of all the functions involvd is described in the comments. The main file handles the logic, and the painters.js file helps in showing the game on the canvas graphically. It basically has one prominent function called gamePlay(), which is called after every 80 milliseconds, whichhelps in validating the movements of the snake, and paintng the snake.

If you think you can add better UI, or add maybe some new power-ups, please do send a pull request, and I will be happy to accept!
